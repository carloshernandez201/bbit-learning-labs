# Project Overview

This repository contains the codebase for an integral component developed as part of a collaborative project supported by Bloomberg Finance L.P through their learning lab. The project aims to establish a robust message queuing system to facilitate efficient data processing and communication within our technological infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Messaging Queue Producer and Consumer Interface:** A foundational class designed to encapsulate the complexities of interacting with a messaging queue service. It provides a streamlined API for publishing messages to specified channels and exchanges, ensuring seamless integration within our data processing pipelines.

## Getting Started

Please note that this repository houses only a segment of the broader project, which is actively developed and maintained within the **tech-lab-on-campus** repository. Interested parties are encouraged to visit the lab for a comprehensive understanding of the project's scope, deployment strategies, and collaborative opportunities.

## Collaboration with Bloomberg

This project is made possible through the generous support and technical assistance of Bloomberg Finance L.P. Their contributions, ranging from expertise in data analytics to strategic resource allocation, have been invaluable in pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve.
